## Introduction

The Library of Congress [data-exploration GitHub](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration) includes several Jupyter notebooks and other tutorials covering Library of Congress data and application programming interfaces (APIs), which are documented in detail at [loc.gov/apis](https://loc.gov/apis). The tutorials are loosely categorized by topic. Under each heading, you can find details on what the tutorial documents contain, the assumed background knowledge, and possible applications of the code provided.

{% include tip.html content="The API is a work in progress and things may change at any time. Fields may be added, deleted, or used in different ways, so make any code you write flexible and able to adjust to changes. Not every item is available via the API yet; some collections are still in process of being made available." %}

Almost all of these documents are Jupyter notebooks, which is a programming environment that runs in a web browser. A notebook can contain both text in a markdown format and Python code that can be run directly as part of the workflow.

If this is your first time using Jupyter notebooks, here are a couple great tutorials online to help you install and set up the software:

* [https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/workshop-RR-Jupyter/setup/](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/workshop-RR-Jupyter/setup/)
* [https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks)

Also, remember that the applications listed are only a few examples intended as a starting point! The possibilities are far wider. We're excited to see what you do with the collections. 

{% include note.html content="This documentation is a resource to help people understand the API and make use of it. Itâ€™s intended to inspire creative uses of the Library of Congress collections. So, it's not comprehensive, but highlights the most relevant aspects. If you have ideas about what else this documentation should cover or anything else to make the API even more useful, let us know by emailing LC-Labs@loc.gov!" %}
