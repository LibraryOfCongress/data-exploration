ARIZONA, JL\\'XLO U. 1906.\\nA BEGGING SENATORSHIP.\\nThe rejection by that unambitious ag\\nlku\\'turist, the Hon. Dwtght Coburn. of\\nthe appointment to the vacant Kansas\\nsenatorship need not be attributed to\\nhis utter disregard of pomp and pow\\ner. Mr. Coburn is already in power,\\nvast power, practically illimitab\\'.e pow\\ner. He is lord of the immeasurable\\ncornfie\\'ds of Kansas, cf wheat fields so\\nwide that the human eye cannot reach\\nthe boundaries. Mr. Coburn is at tha\\nhead of the agricultural department\\nof the most agricultural state in the\\nunion. What more could he desire\\nwithout subjecting himself to the sus\\npicion of sordidness?\\nBesides the prof fere J gift was not as\\nalluring at c\\'ose range as it might have\\nappeared from a distance to be. It will\\ntake a lot of disinfecting to rid it of\\nthe smell of Burton. The odor was one\\nwhich must have boon nauseating to\\none whose nostrils had become used to\\nthe fragrance of new mown hay and\\nthe healthful though frequently homely\\nsmells of the soil.\\nA United States senatorship is some\\nthing we are not accustomed to see\\ndespised. We have known men to pol\\nlute their souls for an opportunity to\\npollute a toga. It can be readily un\\nderstood though that a pure minded\\nman with an over nice sense or uonor\\nwould hesitate to mount to a seat to\\nwhich so much of dishonor has at\\ntached. Then there was not much tim given\\nto a successor of Burton to make the\\ncountry forget Burton. The term wi 1\\nexpire next March. It is this latter\\nfact that probably moved Governor\\nHoch to nominate Mr. Coburn to whom\\nhe owed no overwhelm;ngpo\\'itical debt,\\nsuch as the services of Judge Caldwell\\nimposed upon and such as in a small\\ner measure he owed to JuJge Benson,\\nto whom he has tendered the oppoim\\nment. Both these men contributed\\nlargely to his political making.\\nReverting to Mr. Coburn, there is an\\nother possible reason why he declined\\nthe senatorship which was held out to\\nhim. Perhaps the;e is a touch of sup\\nerstition about him.. That senatorial\\nline from Lane, the suicide down,\\nmight set even an unsupersti\\ntious man to thinking. It is\\nan unbroken line of misfor\\ntune, sudden physical or political death\\nand dishonor. It has long been ca,l!sl\\nin Kansas, the fatal succession.\"\\nIt is a pleasing peculiarity of Judge\\nKent\\'s adjudication of watjr disputes,\\nthat the litigants are not kept wait\\ning long for a status of some sort. In\\nthe complex relations of the water\\nusers of the valley to one another it\\nis difficult to pick out the exact rights\\nof any of them. There is sucn a thing\\nthough, as distributing irrigating water\\nin such a way as to serve the greatest\\npossible number with the least possible\\nprejudice to the rights of any. That\\nwas accomp\\'ishod by the- decree of yes\\nterday. All the litigants of cours.\\ncould not hae all they wanted, biit\\nthey must fee: that thy did very well\\nwith 32.1X10 inches in the river when\\nthere ought to have been at least 60, 0n0.\\nTHE PROBLEM OF PRESIDENTS.\\nMr. Williams\\' suggestion that ex-\\npresidents, ox-blacksmiths and ox-car-rentors\\nshould equally become the\\ncharges of the country will perhaps\\nmeet with more favor throughout the\\ncountry than the other suggestion that\\nformer presidents be maintained in a\\nstation of life to which they had been\\nelevated; sometimes by accident. We\\nlook upon the presidency as a more or\\nless sacred office in which the person\\nality of the occupant is for four or\\neight years lost. But at the end of\\nhis term he regains his personality,\\ntakes it away with him and becomes a\\nplain America n citizen, with the ad\\nvantage over his fellow cili.ens of hav\\ning xecured a place more- or !\\'ss oft\\nin the history of hi.--, country. No pres\\nident has ever retired from ollice in\\nwant or in the vicinity of want. None\\nare likely to do so, but most of them\\nhave retired with earning capabilities\\nincreased by prestige.\\nIt is generally admitted, though, thai\\npresidents should be better paid; that\\nthey should not only receive a more\\nmunificent salary, or, rather, a salary\\nmore nearly munificent, ana tliat jro-\\nvision should be made for their neces\\nsarily heavy expenses.\\nBut it is undoubtedly the belief o\\nthe majority of Americans that, having\\nretired from office, presidents should\\nbo welcomed bark to the ranks on\\nequal terms.\\nStill, the proposition for the pension\\ning of presidents is immensely superior\\nto one advanced and quite widely advo\\ncated a couple of years ago of creating\\nfor them a sort of aristocracy similar\\nto that of the Elder Statesmen of\\nJapan.\\nWe have other problems much more\\nvital than this one of our ex-prcsl-dents.\\nAmericans will welcome home that\\nplucky adopted daughter. Miss May\\nSutton, with as great fervor as if her\\nlaurels were not soiled by defeat. One\\ncannot always be a tennis champion\\nor any other kind of a champion worth\\nbeing.\\nIs it not possible that the failure of\\nthe water works at Cincinnati yester\\nday was a visitation of a just provi\\ndence provoked by a Cincinnati court\\ntaking jurisdiction in the rhoenix\\nwater works matter?\\nLittle James\\n(Thc Views of all Parties to the Late\\nPacking House Expose.)\\nThis here whole Country\\'s been give\\na Emmytick last week.
