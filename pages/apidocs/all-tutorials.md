summary: The data-exploration GitHub includes several Jupyter notebooks and other files that contain tutorials on how to use the API, with example scripts. The tutorials are loosely categorized by topic. Under each heading, you can find details on what the tutorial documents contain, the assumed background knowledge, and possible applications of the code provided.
---

Almost all of these documents are Jupyter notebooks, which is a programming environment that runs in a web browser. A notebook can contain both text in a markdown format and Python code that can be run directly as part of the workflow.

If this is your first time using Jupyter notebooks, there are [several](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/workshop-RR-Jupyter/setup/) great [tutorials](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks) online to help you install and set up the software.

Also, remember that the applications listed are only a few examples intended as a starting point! The possibilities are far wider. We're excited to see what you do with the collections. If you have ideas about how to make the API more useful or more topics that you want us to cover in the documentation, please let us know!

## Chronicling America

>**[Chronicling America](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/ChronAm%20API%20Samples.ipynb)**

The Chronicling America database also has an API that functions similarly to the wider loc.gov API. Its URLs start with https://www.chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ instead of https://www.loc.gov/ but the endings for querying are the same.

This tutorial provides an introduction to what information is available via the API — one notable difference is that since this collection consists of newspaper pages, you can retrieve the text from the page (collected using OCR) via the API. The tutorial also covers searching for keywords and analyzing data from bulk records.

**Background knowledge:**
* Understand URLs for loc.gov API [requests](requests.html) and how to modify them

**Applications:**
* Visualize search results on a map
* Find certain quotes through time
* Do historical research
* See [these projects](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2016/08/the-neh-chronicling-america-challenge-using-big-data-to-ask-big-questions/) for more!

>**[Chronicling America CSV](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/tree/master/chronam_all_digitized)**
