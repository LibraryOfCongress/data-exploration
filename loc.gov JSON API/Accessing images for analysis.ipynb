    "\n",
    "### Rights and access\n",
    "Rights and restrictions, including copyright, affect how you can use images, particularly if you want to publish, display, or otherwise distribute them. You can read more in [About Copyright and the Collections](https://www.loc.gov/legal/). This notebook uses images from the Prints & Photographs Division (P&P), and you can read more about restrictions guidance for these materials at [Copyright and Other Restrictions That Apply to Publication/Distribution of Images:\n",
    "Assessing the Risk of Using a P&P Image](http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/195_copr.html). There is also information about rights specific to the collection and item in several fields in the API response. See the end of this notebook for relevant fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image sizes and information about collections\n",
    "In many cases, the images from the Prints & Photographs Division available via the API are a small thumbnail (150px on one side). Consider whether this is sufficient for your research methods and needs. If you need to work with higher resolution images than are available via the API, you'll need to consult with staff who work with the collection(s) to determine whether those are available for use on-site at the Library of Congress and what restrictions apply. Here are some examples of images that are 150px on one side: \n",
    "\n",
    "![https://www.loc.gov/item/2017691815/](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/fsa/8b02000/8b02800/8b02895_150px.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "It can also be helpful to discuss with staff your intended analysis, as factors such as the sources of metadata and how items were digitized may affect your findings. The [Ask a Librarian](http://www.loc.gov/rr/askalib/) service can help you get in touch with staff who work with the collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More APIs for working with images\n",
    "Outside of the Prints & Photographs Division images, most of the Library of Congress images are available from an [IIIF API](https://www.loc.gov/apis/micro-services/image-services/), including for example those of newspapers in the [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) collection, [images from the Mansucript Division](https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=online-format:image%7Cpartof:manuscript+division), and [images of maps](https://www.loc.gov/maps/?fa=online-format:image). The IIIF API allows you to zoom, rotate, resize, and work with images in more complex ways. For a brief intro to using the IIIF API, see [this Jupyter notebook on IIIF](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/loc.gov%20IIIF%20API/IIIF.ipynb). \n",

    "So let's get started accessing images! If you haven't already, browse or search the [Library of Congress Digital Collections](https://www.loc.gov/collections) website to see what is available and refine your search parameters. The website lets you search over 500 curated collections by keyword, format, topic, and division. While the API documentation has [detailed information on parameters](https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/) you can use in your search, searching the collections often gives you good context that is useful in understanding the context of an image within its collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've found a search that targets the items that interest you, **copy the URL**. That will be the **base URL** for your API request. \n",

    "\n",
    "``https://www.loc.gov/collections/baseball-cards/``\n",

    "* ``c=100`` a count of 100 results in each response, rather than the default 25\n",

However, if your images are from more than one collection, you might end up with files with the same name and end up overwriting them. And either way, these filenames don't tell you anything about the item. You might need to look up further metadata. So, here's an alternative approach that renames the file with the identifier used on the loc.gov website. We'll first re-fetch the image URL for each item and download the file, renaming it using the identifier. "
