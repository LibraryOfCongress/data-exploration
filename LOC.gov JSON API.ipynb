    "# Purpose of this Guide\n",
    "The Library of Congress has created an API to allow for automated processes to interact with its collections data. The way that we interact with this data is through JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is JSON?\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What skills do you need to navigate it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading\n",
    "* Curiosity\n",
    "* A willingness to try (and maybe mess up and then try again)\n",
    "\n",
    "# What can you do with it?\n",
    "Explore, discover, and make cool stuff! Let's look at some examples you can try:\n",
    "\n",
    "## A look at the trending content\n",
    "What's the latest on the Library of Congress homepage? We can explore what's happening by asking for the JSON data about the trending content:"
