# Resources for using Library of Congress Data Packages

This is a growing collection of resources (Jupyter Notebooks, scripts, workflows) for accessing and using [data packages from the Library of Congress](https://data.labs.loc.gov/).

To run the Jupyter Notebooks you will need to change into this directory and install the required Python libraries:

```
cd "Data Packages"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
