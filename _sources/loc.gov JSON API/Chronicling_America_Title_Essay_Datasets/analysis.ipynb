       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; in 1844. Its competitor, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press &lt;/em&gt;(later known as the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, Puckett having previously edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Southern Rights&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Fant having apprenticed with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &amp;#8220;Bourbons,&amp;#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the &lt;a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Evening Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and became the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe short-lived weekly &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, the leading weekly newspapers the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Columbia Daily Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry Weekly Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for news items. He published only six issues of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, four of which have survived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&amp;#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has continued through several title changes into the present.

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; began as the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenwood Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1881. Although only a few issues of the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus &lt;/em&gt;have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt; and renamed it the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edgefield Advertiser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the &lt;em&gt;American Newspaper Directory&lt;/em&gt; recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sumter Watchman and Southron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &amp;#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninety-Six Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; in 1844. Its competitor, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press &lt;/em&gt;(later known as the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, Puckett having previously edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Southern Rights&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Fant having apprenticed with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &amp;#8220;Bourbons,&amp;#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association.

       "0  <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the <em>Abbeville Independent Press</em>, Puckett having previously edited the <a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"><em>Anderson Southern Rights</em> <em>Advocate</em></a> and Fant having apprenticed with the <a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"><em>Anderson Gazette</em></a>. During the Civil War, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and merged it with the <em>Abbeville Press</em> to create the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the <em>Press and Banner</em> generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the <em>Independent Press</em>, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the <em>Press and Banner</em>, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the <a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"><em>Press and Banner</em></a>. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the <a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"><em>Abbeville Evening Medium</em></a> and became the <a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"><em>Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium</em></a>. The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</p>   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, the leading weekly newspapers the <a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"><em>Abbeville Press</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"><em>Abbeville Banner</em></a> had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the <a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"><em>Columbia Daily Phoenix</em></a>, <a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"><em>Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer</em></a>, and <a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"><em>Newberry Weekly Herald</em></a> for news items. He published only six issues of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, four of which have survived.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em> was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the <em>Abbeville Press</em> with the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> to create the <a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"><em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em></a>, which has continued through several title changes into the present. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</p>   \n",

The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> began as the <a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"><em>Greenwood Saluda Argus</em></a> in 1881. Although only a few issues of the <em>Saluda Argus </em>have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the <em>Saluda Argus</em> and renamed it the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly <a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"><em>Edgefield Advertiser</em></a>, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the <em>American Newspaper Directory</em> recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the <em>Abbeville Medium</em> and <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"><em>Anderson Intelligencer</em></a> announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"><em>Sumter Watchman and Southron</em></a> reported that the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&#8221;&#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the <a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"><em>Ninety-Six Guardian</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"><em>Newberry News</em></a>. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</p>   \n",
       "3  <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W.

The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites.

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The short-lived weekly Abbeville Bulletin (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Abbeville Messenger (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19 th century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the Abbeville Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</td>\n",

       "0  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.   \n",

The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.   \n",
       "3  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The short-lived weekly Abbeville Bulletin (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Abbeville Messenger (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19 th century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the Abbeville Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "0  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.   \n",

The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.   \n",
       "3  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The short-lived weekly Abbeville Bulletin (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Abbeville Messenger (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19 th century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the Abbeville Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "0  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.   \n",

The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.   \n",
       "3  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",
