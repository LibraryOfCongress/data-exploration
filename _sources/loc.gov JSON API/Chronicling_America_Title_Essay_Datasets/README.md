This project was created by [Daniel Evans](https://github.com/danieljohnevans) while working as a Pathways Intern with the [Division of Preservation and Access at the National Endownment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/preservation)from 2022-2023.

Daniel Evans is a PhD student at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign. His research uses natural language processing and machine learning to explore the history of the book, the history of computing, and digital archives. More recently, his work has been centered on equity and access, information retrieval, and cultural analytics in digital libraries.



These notebooks are meant to assist in drawing out research questions from American print culture. They act as starting points through which researchers can download all title essays and associated metadata, but also allow researchers to curate their own data sets through the selection of specific time period, location, or metadata fields. Furthermore, the code within them provides points for researchers to ask further questions from Chronicling America that are not immediately available in the current metadata or full-text search.
