# LC Maps for Robots

This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks exploring how to computationally access, retrieve, and analyze cartographic materials in the [Library of Congress's online collections](https://loc.gov).

We also recommend checking out the many other wonderful tutorials, demonstration code, and example projects at [LC for Robots](https://labs.loc.gov/lc-for-robots/)! 

## Set up

These notebooks are designed to be downloaded to your computer and opened with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 

If this is your first time using GitHub or git, the easiest way to download these files is to go to https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/ and download the entire repository of files as a ZIP file. 

If this is your first time using Jupyter Notebook, there are [many](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/workshop-RR-Jupyter/setup/) online [tutorials](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks) to help you install the software and get started.
