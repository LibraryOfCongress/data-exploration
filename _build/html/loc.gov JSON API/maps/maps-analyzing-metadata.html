<h2>1. Required Prep: Install and import all of the Python modules we’ll need<a class="headerlink" href="#required-prep-install-and-import-all-of-the-python-modules-we-ll-need" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Most of the modules we’ll be using in this notebook come pre-packaged with Anaconda. If you installed Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda, you’ll have all of the required packages except one: plotly. You’ll need to install plotly if it isn’t already installed.
To install it, open a terminal window (outside of this notebook) and install plotly. One of the easiest ways of installing Python modules is by using pip, as in this tutorial from W3C: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp</a>. If you have a preferred package manager, you may use that instead.</p>
<p>If you run the cell below and encounter any errors, be sure to check that all the packages are installed.</p>
<p>If you can’t install plotly and you are planning to skip those sections of this notebook, you can simply comment out the plotly import by adding a hash at the beginning of the line:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#import plotly.express as px </span>

<h2>2. Query for list of records<a class="headerlink" href="#query-for-list-of-records" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>If you’d just finished the previous notebook, <a class="reference internal" href="maps-downloading-querying.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Querying and downloading cartographic material from loc.gov</span></a> , then you’ve just downloaded a set of GIF images. These images represent all of the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps for 19th century towns named “Springfield”. If you haven’t completed the previous notebook, that’s ok. It’s not required.</p>
<p>Let’s retrieve the metadata associated with these files, such as titles, publication dates, and locations. We’ll save it as a CSV alongside your downloaded files, so you can refer back to it later.</p>
<p>If you were writing your own code, you would probably want to get the metadata at the same time you download the files, to minimize API requests and save time. But for the purposes of our demo, we’ll make new API requests to get the metadata.</p>
<p>If you remember, our search query was saved into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">searchURL</span></code> variable as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/?dates=1800/1899&amp;amp;fa=location:springfield">https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/?dates=1800/1899&amp;fa=location:springfield</a>. Let’s recreate that.</p>
<p>We also created a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_item_ids</span></code> function, to get the IDs of our query results. Let’s recreate that as well.</p>

<p>When we run a search query, we get a significant amount of metadata about each of the results. However, it’s not the full metadata about each item. For example, it doesn’t include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">location</span></code> metadata. To get the full metadata, after we run our query we must then request each of the results’ item records.</p>
<p>We’ll run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_item_ids</span></code> function above, which runs our initial search query. It will save a list of item ids to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ids</span></code> variable. Later, we’ll get the full item records and metadata for each atlas.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">

<p>Now we’ll write a function to request the full item record for each of our 22 search results. This function will fetch each item record as JSON, and retrieve selected fields we specify. For this example, let’s say that we want the following metadata fields:</p>

<p class="lead">Tip</p>
<p>Most web browsers have built-in JSON viewers. Try copying the link above labelled “View item record json in your web browser” into various browsers, to see how they each visualize JSON.</p>
<p>You can also view the full JSON item record in this Jupyter notebook by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">item_metadata</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(item_metadata)</span></code>.</p>
</div><hr class="docutils" />
<p class="lead">How is the metadata structured?</p>
<p>Notice in the output above that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Notes</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Location</span></code> values are in square brackets:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Notes</span><span class="p">:</span> 
<span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39; Feb 1884. &#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39; 15. &#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">Location</span><span class="p">:</span> 
<span class="p">[{</span><span class="s1">&#39;illinois&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=location:illinois&amp;fo=json&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;sangamon county&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=location:sangamon+county&amp;fo=json&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;springfield&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=location:springfield&amp;fo=json&#39;</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This indicates that these values are Python lists, containing multiple values. Each value in the list is separated by a comma. In <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Notes</span></code>, there are two values in the list, and each is surrounded by single quotes.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="http://loc.gov">loc.gov</a>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Notes</span></code> is a general field that can contain a range of information. For Sanborns, it is used to hold publication date and number of sheets. In this example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">15</span></code> indicates 15 sheets in this particular Sanborn atlas.</p>
<p>The structure of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Location</span></code> field is a little more complicated. It’s a list, but each item in the list is a Python dictionary. The example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Location</span></code> above is a list of three dictionaries. The first dictionary in the list looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;illinois&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=location:illinois&amp;fo=json&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Curly brackets are used around dictionaries; square brackets are around lists. This dictionary has a single “key:value” pair. The key is “illinois”. The value is a URL.</p>
<p>The URL isn’t useful for our purposes. For this example item, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Location</span></code> has three dictionaries, and their keys are: “illinois”, “sangamon county”, and “springfield”. This tells us that the atlas is in Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois. Notice that the metadata itself doesn’t indicate any hierarchy between the locations.</p>
<p>When we harvest our metadata, we’re going to save it into a CSV file. For this CSV, any fields that contain lists will be split into muiltple columns. For location, we’ll get the keys (like “illinois”, “sangamon county”, “springfield”) and we’ll ignore the URLs.</p>
<p class="lead">Let's create a function that will harvest item record metadata into a CSV.</p>
<p>The function will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>take our list of items (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ids</span></code>)</p></li>
<li><p>use the API to request each item record as JSON</p></li>
<li><p>extract the metadata fields we want from each record</p></li>
<li><p>add those fields to something Python calls a “dataframe”</p></li>
<li><p>save the dataframe as a CSV file</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The functions in this notebook are large and do many things. In the real world, best practice for Python functions is usually to break them up into multiple small functions, where each function does one thing.</p>

<h1>4. Basic metadata analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-metadata-analysis" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Now you have a CSV spreadsheet of metadata. If you completed the previous Jupyter notebook, you also have image files for these atlases downloaded to your computer (we’ll assume for our purposes that you completed that notebook, but it’s ok if you haven’t).</p>
<p>All of the information in that CSV is also at hand in this Jupyter notebook, in what’s called a “dataframe”. Dataframes come with the “Pandas” Python library, and you can do lots of things with dataframes that you can’t easily do with dictionaries or lists.</p>
<p>In the last notebook, each of your image files was downloaded into a folder on your computer. These folders are named according to the ID of each item.</p>
<p>For example, you might have a folder called “sanborn02163_001”, containing a GIF image file for each page. These images belong to a Sanborn atlas with the id “sanborn02163_001”, which can be found online at <a class="reference external" href="https://loc.gov/item/sanborn02163_001">https://loc.gov/item/sanborn02163_001</a></p>
<p>Using our dataframe of metadata, we can quickly pull up basic metadata about the atlas in the sanborn02163_001 folder, like location and date. We’ll do this by looking for the string ‘sanborn02163_001’ in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id_simplified</span></code> column.</p>

<p>We can see that “sanborn02163_001” is a map of Springfield in Sangamon County, Illinois from February 1884. It has 15 sheets. (The number of sheets is in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">notes</span></code> field. We’ve also calculated it from the number of files in the JSON’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resource</span></code> field, and saved this to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">page_count</span></code> column.)</p>
<p class="lead">Did we download any other atlases from the same Springfield in Sangamon County? </p>
<p>Let’s see. We’ll look in our dataframe for rows where the strings ‘illinois’, ‘sangamon county’, and ‘springfield’  appear in any of the location columns (alternatively, we could also search using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title</span></code> field, but we’ll stick with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">location</span></code> field for now.)</p>

<h1>6. Metadata maps and Wikidata<a class="headerlink" href="#metadata-maps-and-wikidata" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p class="lead">Let's get a larger set of metadata, and visualize it with a choropleth map and timeline map. </p>
<p>Python has many visualization modules that build on Matplotlib. Here, we’ll use one called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plotly</span></code>. Let’s use it to visualize information about Sanborn mapping of Illinois counties over time.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll need to get some extra metadata from Wikidata, about the counties’ locations.</p>
<p>Specifically, we’ll:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>get metadata from <a class="reference external" href="http://loc.gov">loc.gov</a> for all of the Illinois Sanborn atlases online</p></li>
<li><p>get location information from Wikidata for each Illinois county</p></li>
<li><p>map the atlases, by county and publication year</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To combine the <a class="reference external" href="http://loc.gov">loc.gov</a> data with Wikidata data, we’ll use something called a SPARQL query. This is how data is retrieved from Wikidata, using SPARQL.</p>
<p class="lead">First, let's write a new function that gets metadata about Illinois Sanborns from loc.gov. </p>
<p>For our location metadata, we need to get county names. In order to minimize the number of API requests we’ll make, let’s parse the county names from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title</span></code> field rather than from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">location</span></code> metadata field. This will allow us to get all our information from our query results, without having to reach atlas’s individual item records. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">location</span></code> field is in the item records, but isn’t in the query result records.</p>
<p>The county metadata is a little messy. We’ll need to account for various types of “counties”, as in these examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Belle Glade, Palm Beach County, Florida” (standard pattern)</p></li>
<li><p>“Cape Girardeau, Cape Girardeau, Missouri” (counties missing the word “County”)</p></li>
<li><p>“Mankato, Blue Earth And Nicollet Counties, Minnesota” (two counties)</p></li>
<li><p>“Kansas City, Jackson, Clay, And Platte Counties, Missouri” (three or more counties)</p></li>
<li><p>“Saint Louis, Independent City, Missouri” (cities without counties)</p></li>
<li><p>“New Orleans, Orleans Parish, Louisiana” (county-like entities)</p></li>
<li><p>“Juneau, Juneau Census Division, Alaska” (county-like entities whose status has changed over time)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll tackle this inside our function, with a series of regular expressions. More details are in the comments within the function.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="lead"> Run the next cell to: </p> 
<p>define the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_Sanborn_counties</span></code> function, which creates a dataframe of atlases based on an API query. Any atlas that is labelled with more than one county (or county-like entity) will have a row for each county.</p>

<p class="lead">Great!</p>
<p>Now we have a dataframe of all the Illinois Sanborn atlases, split up so that there is one row per county per atlas.</p>
<p>In order to map data, mapping tools needs access to information about the counties’ locations. There are lots of ways to get this information, and different types of location information we can get.</p>
<p>For one of our maps, we’ll use a geojson file from Plotly that matches counties’ “FIPS” codes with polygons (county borders). FIPS codes are used by the Census Bureau and other U.S. federal agencies to uniquely identify counties and county-like entities. For another map, we’ll use coordinates for counties’ center points.</p>
<p>We’ll go to Wikidata to get the necessary data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>county FIPS code</p></li>
<li><p>county coordinates, which contains the center point latitude and longitude</p></li>
</ul>
<p>First, we need to reorganize our dataframe so that we have one row per county. To do this, we can use the Pandas function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.groupby()</span></code>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p class="lead"> Run the next cell to: </p> 
<p>reorganize the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atlases_df</span></code> dataframe into a dataframe of counties, with one county per row, and save the new dataframe to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">counties_df</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">count</span></code> column will be the total count of atlases for that county.</p>
<p>The cell below will print the first 5 counties.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, we’ll want to define a function to pull the FIPS codes and coordinates from Wikidata. We’ll want to feed our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">county</span></code> column to the function, and get three new columns in return:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fips</span></code> - fips code</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lat</span></code> - latitude</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> - longitude</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our function will use a SPARQL query to get this information from Wikidata.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="lead">SPARQL queries</p>

<p>Scroll to the bottom of the results above to look at the dataframe table.</p>
<p>Notice Cook county high on the list? Chicago is in Cook County, which explains why the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">county_bycounty</span></code> value (123) is so high. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">county_bycounty</span></code> is the total number of online atlase volumes for Cook county across all years.</p>
<p class="lead">Our data is ready for mapping.</p>
<p>First, let’s make what’s called a choropleth map, where Illinois’s counties are colored according to how many atlas volumes are online for that county. This visualization relies on the FIPS codes we pulled from Wikidata.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">

<p>generate a choropleth map of all Illinois Sanborn atlases online at <a class="reference external" href="http://loc.gov">loc.gov</a>, by county.</p>
